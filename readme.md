# What's this?

This is the *Software engineering 2* 2016-2017 course project at Politecnico di Milano: **PowerEnjoy**.

The objective of this project is to apply in practice what we learn during lectures with the purpose of becoming confident with software engineering practices and able to address new software engineering issues in a rigorous way.

We are to develop a digital management system for a car-sharing service that exclusively employs electric cars.
The complete problem description can be found in *Assignments AA 2016-2017.pdf*.

The project includes five assignments:

1. RASD: Requirement Analisys and Specification Document
2. DD: Design Document
3. ITPD: Integration Test Plan Document
4. PP: Project Plan

# Ok, let me see the documents

Document releases are in the *Releases* directory.

# I just want to know how everything is structured

This is a kind of table of contents of all our documents.
